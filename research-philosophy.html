        <h2>Statement of Research Philosophy</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">As a university lecturer and active researcher, I see research as a lifelong commitment to inquiry, innovation, and social impact. My research journey began during my PhD at the University of Sharjah, where I built a solid foundation in scientific investigation, methodology, and interdisciplinary exploration. Since then, I have continuously pursued meaningful research that bridges theory with practice, particularly in the fields of Data Science, Information Quality, and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">My research philosophy is grounded in the belief that impactful scholarship should address real‑world problems and generate practical solutions. I am particularly driven by the growing challenges in information quality management in data‑rich environments such as the Internet of Things (IoT), eHealth systems, and smart infrastructures. I approach research with a strong focus on conceptual frameworks, empirical rigour, and social relevance.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">A significant stream of my work involves developing a framework for assessing Information Quality in IoT systems. This framework integrates the House of Quality (HoQ) methodology to link user needs with technical and quality parameters. It evaluates data quality dimensions (accuracy, completeness, timeliness), technical components (sensors, security, connectivity), and information governance processes (validation, maintenance, and control). This research has resulted in several peer‑reviewed publications, including a case study on medical wearable devices, demonstrating its applicability in healthcare and other domains.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to technical research, I actively contribute to AI‑powered interdisciplinary projects. As a Co‑Principal Investigator, I am currently involved in the project “Study for Children’s Psychological Assessment from Their Drawing using Artificial Intelligence” (Sure PLUS, UAE University, 2024–2025). This research explores the use of deep learning and computer vision techniques to screen children’s emotional and cognitive development through their drawings, in collaboration with educational institutions. Another ongoing project, “A Green Computing Initiative for Energy and Environmental Sustainability Using Green Data Mining and Green Machine Learning”, focuses on leveraging AI techniques to reduce energy consumption and promote sustainability in computing infrastructures. These projects reflect my commitment to using data science and AI to address socially important issues.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In conducting research, I emphasise methodological integrity, clarity, and ethics. My process includes thorough literature reviews, clear problem formulation, proper data handling, and effective dissemination. I apply both qualitative and quantitative methods depending on the nature of the research, always ensuring the validity and relevance of outcomes. Moreover, I strongly value collaboration and interdisciplinarity. I engage with researchers from diverse fields to enhance research depth and generate richer insights. I welcome critical feedback, peer reviews, and academic discourse as essential tools to refine ideas and ensure quality. I also mentor students and early‑career researchers, encouraging them to contribute to collaborative projects and explore innovative research pathways.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In conclusion, I see research not as an isolated academic duty but as a dynamic process of exploration and service. Through rigorous inquiry, cross‑disciplinary teamwork, and commitment to innovation, I strive to make meaningful contributions to the fields of information systems, artificial intelligence, and digital sustainability—while also fostering an inclusive and collaborative research environment.</p>
